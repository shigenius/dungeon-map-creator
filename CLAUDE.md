## Project Overview

This is a 3D Dungeon RPG mapping tool - a fully implemented web-based map editor for creating and managing dungeon maps for 3D RPGs. The application features a sophisticated 2D grid-based editor with real-time editing capabilities and is designed for 3D preview functionality.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript and Vite as build tool
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with structured slices
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) with dark theme
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js (prepared, basic implementation pending)
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E testing
- **Data Format**: JSON with complex nested structures

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with a component-based React architecture:

1. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with two main slices:
   - `mapSlice`: Manages dungeon data, cell modifications, undo/redo history (50 steps)
   - `editorSlice`: Manages UI state (tools, layers, zoom, view modes, hover information)

2. **Component Structure**:
   - `App.tsx`: Main application with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and layout
   - `MainCanvas.tsx`: Central component managing 2D/3D view mode switching
   - `MapEditor2D.tsx`: Core canvas-based map editing with detailed tool implementations
   - Panel components: MenuBar, ToolBar, LeftPanel, RightPanel, BottomPanel
   - `NewProjectDialog.tsx`: Project creation workflow with size validation

3. **Data Flow**: 
   - User interactions ‚Üí Redux actions ‚Üí State updates ‚Üí Canvas redraw
   - Keyboard shortcuts (App level) ‚Üí Direct Redux dispatch
   - Hover events ‚Üí editorSlice ‚Üí Real-time UI updates
   - Batch operations ‚Üí `updateCells` action ‚Üí Performance optimization

4. **Map Structure**: Complex hierarchical data model:
   - Dungeon ‚Üí Floors ‚Üí Cells ‚Üí (Floor properties/Wall configurations/Events/Decorations)
   - Each cell supports detailed properties, multiple event types, and custom flags

## Key Data Structures

### Cell Structure
Each map cell contains:
- Position coordinates (x, y)
- Floor properties (type, texture, passability)
- Wall data for all 4 directions (north, east, south, west)
- Events array
- Decorations array
- Custom properties

### Event System
Events support:
- Multiple trigger types (auto, interact, contact, item use, etc.)
- Complex action chains with conditional branching
- 8+ event types (treasure, NPC, stairs, enemies, etc.)
- Flag-based state management

## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build       # Build for production (includes TypeScript check)
npm run preview     # Preview production build
npm run lint        # Run ESLint with TypeScript rules
```

### Testing (Playwright)
```bash
npm run test        # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:ui     # Run Playwright with UI mode
```

### Common Development Workflow
```bash
npm run dev         # Start dev server in background
# Make changes to src/ files
npm run build       # Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run test        # Run browser tests
```

## Implemented Features

### ‚úÖ Core Map Editor
- Grid-based 2D map editing with HTML5 Canvas and precise coordinate calculation
- Multiple drawing tools: pen, rectangle, fill, eyedropper, select with Shift-key modifiers
- Multi-layer system: floor, walls, events, decorations with visibility toggles
- Real-time canvas redrawing with zoom (10%-400%) and grid toggle
- Undo/Redo system with 50-step history using deep cloning
- Batch cell updates for performance optimization
- Advanced hover system with cell content preview and highlighting

### ‚úÖ User Interface
- Material-UI dark theme with responsive Flexbox layout
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts (20+ combinations including layer switching)
- Project creation dialog with configurable map size (5√ó5 to 100√ó100)
- Panel-based layout with accordion components for floor/wall type management
- Real-time cell information display with hover highlighting
- 2D/3D view mode switching (3D prepared)
- Template creation dialog with category selection and description

### ‚úÖ Data Management
- JSON import/export functionality with fileUtils integration
- Redux state persistence with two main slices (mapSlice, editorSlice)
- Complex hierarchical data model: Dungeon ‚Üí Floors ‚Üí Cells ‚Üí Properties
- Structured cell editing with detailed floor types (8) and wall configurations
- Event system data structures supporting 10+ trigger types and 12+ action types
- User-created template system with range selection and persistent storage

### ‚úÖ Template System
- Comprehensive template management with preset and user-created templates
- Category-based organization (room, corridor, junction, trap, puzzle, decoration, fullmap, custom)
- Template placement tool with real-time preview and rotation (0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞)
- Range selection mode for creating templates from existing map areas
- Full map templates that replace entire dungeon layouts
- Template creation dialog with name, description, and category selection
- Template rotation utilities with proper wall orientation handling

### üöß Pending Implementation
- Three.js 3D preview system
- Advanced event system with complex triggers
- Map validation and balance checking
- Decoration system implementation

## Performance Constraints

- Maximum map size: 100√ó100√ó10 floors
- Maximum events per floor: 1000
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Single floor editing at a time

## File Structure Expectations

The project should be organized with:
- Frontend React components for the map editor UI
- Three.js components for 3D rendering
- Redux store for state management
- Rails API endpoints for data persistence
- JSON Schema definitions for validation
- Template system for reusable components

## UI Architecture

The interface consists of:
- Menu bar (file operations, edit, view, tools, help)
- Toolbar (quick tool access)
- Left panel (layers, object list)
- Main canvas (map editing area)
- Right panel (properties, templates)
- Bottom panel (coordinates, zoom, validation results)
